I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University (State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor. Degree from Jilin University in 2016. My research interests lay on the quality assurance of complex software systems and the implementation of reliable software infrastructure.
